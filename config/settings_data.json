Now, over 10 years later, this community of over 300 artisans are still at the heart of everything we do, and are the genius behind the 200+ handcrafted products you all have grown to love so much. Our neighbors (that’s you) have made a huge impact on our tiny rural economy. We thank you, and the artisans thank you.",

There they found a tightknit community and 100 goats looking for a home. Next thing you know, they were making goat milk soap at the kitchen table. <br> They shared with Neighbors, and before long, stories started pouring in about the soap’s incredible effects. Upstate winters are hard, particularly on skin, but the soap cleared up one Neighbor’s eczema and another’s rosacea. Folks with sensitive skin raved. <br> Goat milk has been used for centuries as a natural remedy for sensitive skin—and the proof was on our Neighbors’ faces. Intrigued, Josh and Dr. Brent honed in on the science and discovered how it could be used as a powerfully effective ingredient for moisturizing, exfoliation, and nourishing your skin’s microbiome. Plus, it’s also safe and gentle on sensitive skin. <br> Neighbor by Neighbor, word spread—from soap to science to more skincare products. Beekman 1802 didn’t start out a beauty brand, but it became one—the world’s biggest goat-milk based skincare company, with millions of Beekman Neighbors who now have healthier, happier skin.",

They eat alfalfa hay, as well as a blend of grains including oats, barley, and corn. In addition, the goats receive almond hulls for fiber, salt blocks for digestion, and vitamin and mineral supplements for overall well-being. They also have plenty of fresh water on demand at all times. <br><br> At the farms, the goats have plenty of room to roam around during the day to both the inside and outside areas. Shelters provide protection from the seasonal elements such as extreme heat, cold, or rain. <br><br> Goats are very social animals, so our farmer partners make sure to keep them together, and provide them plenty of open space.   It is important to note that these farms are regularly inspected by state and county agencies.",

Back in 2008, a local heritage soap maker masterfully hand-batched our first ever bar of soap from the confines of her own cottage, and from there we were introduced to a vibrant local community of talented craftspeople filled with passion and potential. Now, over 10 years later, this community of over 300 artisans are still at the heart of everything we do, and are the genius behind the 200+ handcrafted products you all have grown to love so much. Our neighbors (that’s you) have made a huge impact on our tiny rural economy. We thank you, and the artisans thank you."
